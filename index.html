          We believe that healthy eating, clean air, and gentle character is the
          best start to genuine wellbeing. Juicing can reduce your risk of
          cancer, boost your immune system, remove toxins from your body, aid
          digestion and help you lose weight.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, there's no scientific evidence that extracted juices are
          healthier than the juice you get by eating the fruit or vegetable
          itself.

        <p>
          Oranges have such a bright, hardy appearance, but their trees are
          rather delicate. To make sure the best fruits get the nutrients they
          need to reach full ripeness, the trees will drop younger, smaller
          oranges when resources are scarce.
        </p>
        <p>
          Experience the cold-pressed difference in organic orange juice that
          tastes like oranges, not “OJ.” Organic oranges packed with vitamin C
          are picked and squeezed at the peak of sweet flavor.

          It's important to maintain the balance of nutrients for good health.
          Too much weight gain is linked to high blood pressure, stroke,
          diabetes, cardiac issues, and other negative health issues later in
          life. Loads and loads of sugar in your juice is a strict no-no.

          <h3>About Juice</h3>
          <p>
            Juice is a drink made from the extraction or pressing of the natural
            liquid contained in fruit and vegetables. It can also refer to
            liquids that are flavored with concentrate or other biological food
            sources, such as meat or seafood, such as clam juice.
